As a software engineer I find that I rarely get to practice the fundamentals of computer science. I also rarely get a chance to practice the kinds of problems that I'm going to be facing every day. At the school that I'm currently teaching one thing that the students have been doing every day is called 'toy problems'. Toy problems have a pretty straight forward concept. They are problems that should make you think a bit, shouldn't take too long, and let you exercise your programming brain muscles.

### Practice makes perfect
Too often I've known even senior software engineers that have problems writing simple functions. Heck, sometimes I have problems writing simple functions. Most of a software engineers' day can be taken up by all kinds of other distractions. There are meetings to attend. New libraries to evaluate. Production issues and all kinds of other problems that can make it difficult to get to the writing code part. A small problem once or twice a week to keep the chops in shape, or for a beginner to really grow, is definitely one way to combat this problem.

### But Toy Problems are Silly
Yeah they are. Personally I would rather be solving real problems, but the truth is real problems are intricate and take time. These smaller problems are like daily calisthenics that can keep you in shape for when you really need to get something done.

### Toy Problems Aren't For Everyone
Don't get me wrong I don't think toy problems are for everyone. Obviously some people have too many things going on. Some people are working on real problems all day and don't find toy problems relaxing or a fun way to spend spare time. That makes sense to me. I personally love algorithmic problems and find a measure of joy in solving small problems every day. If that isn't for you then find something else to exercise your programming chops. 

### My Goal for the Foreseeable Future
In that vein I've started a bit of small side project. Something to help people that want to practice every day and also want problems. I've decided to keep track of my daily toy problems on GitHub and see how long my streak can be. The rules are as follows. I do one a day. I don't have to blog about them, but if I do great. I want them to have some tests and to be confident that they are working as described. If you would like to see check out my repo [here](https://github.com/charltonaustin/toy-problems)
